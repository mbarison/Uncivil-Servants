# Uncivil Servants

_A game about teamwork and backstabbing._

The current Deputy Minister is retiring in a year, and you need to show competence and gain the favour of the current government, so you can succeed as the next Deputy Minister. You can collaborate with the other players to make your agency more prestigious, or you can decide to sabotage your fellow Directors to discredit them in the eyes of the goverment. Which way will you play?
