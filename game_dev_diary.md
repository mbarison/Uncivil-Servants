# Game Developer Diary

## January 20th, 2024

Inspired by the [_Republic of Rome_](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/1513/republic-rome) games I played in my youth, I would like a game mechanism where the players are sort of forced to collaborate at the beginning of the game. The agency is weak, lacks means, and is in trouble. Sure, the players can already backstab right now, but the risk of triggering an end-game catastrophe is looming. Backstabbing should be left for the end of the game. I will figure out how to implement it later.

In the original concept, I assumed only an employee revolt could trigger the game end. Now I have made _Employee Engagement_ one of the three scoring tracks of the game. If any of the three tracks goes to the bottom of the scale, everyone loses (perhaps I could require 2 out of 3 for beginners). Going to the plus side could trigger one-off bonuses, while going to the minus side could trigger temporary minuses. For example, less manpower, etc.

I think each Quarter should have one (or three?) Targets, that the agency needs to fulfill. If fulfilled, players get Victory Points, if failed, they lose positions on the projects tracks.

I also think I should have one Random Event per quarter, that could be either beneficial or detrimental. Perhaps additional Random Events could be added if a Target is failed or incrementally over the course of the game.

I would really like to use the [_Red Flag over Paris_](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/296577/red-flag-over-paris) card system for playing, but I am not entirely sure how it's going to interact with Targets, Projects and Random Events.
